<H4>The repository contains a project template for android studio, thanks to which you can use the 3D irrlich graphic library in your applications. The project contains debug versions of the irrlicht library for arm, arm64, x86, and x86_64. For this, you can download the repository and build your android apk app.</H4>

But beware ðŸ˜®ðŸ˜¯ðŸ˜², these are large files and github showed warning: warning: File app / src / main / cpp / libs / arm64-v8a / libIrrlicht.a is 70.85 MB; this is larger than GitHub's recommended maximum file size of 50.00 MB. can be damaged, it's best to build irrlicht on your own, but I'll put the correct versions using recomended app Git Large File Storage.
